# SearchEngine

Built a custom search engine that uses filtering to rank results. The engine will get results from the Google Custom Search API, store them, then rank them based on predefined filters.  

It filters based on the number of trackers on the page, and the length of the content.  The framework will be extensible, so you can add your own filters, including ones that use machine learning.
